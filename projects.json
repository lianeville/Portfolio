		"description": "Silly Chat is a lightweight chat web app that lets users talk anonymously without needing an account. One thing that's always annoyed me about the internet is almost every site begging you to create an account and enter your email, phone number, or whatever else, so I wanted to this to be different. It lets uses create sessions, and chat publicly and anonymously without needing to create an account, but still makes it clear who's talking by assigning each user a random name.",

I developed it gradually the whole time, and eventually decided to make it agnostic to Docket for anybody to use it. I'm particularly proud of the coloring system; each of the filter's categories becomes bright and colorful when that category is filtered, and all currently active filters are displayed below and organized by color, so you always know what's being filtered at a glance.",
